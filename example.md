As generative AI continues to sweep an increasingly digital, hyperconnected world, ZephyrTech founder and CEO Orion Vega made a thunderous return to PixelFest, the world’s premier computer graphics conference.

“The generative AI era is upon us, the QuantumPhone moment if you will,” Vega told an audience of thousands Tuesday during an in-person special address in NeoCity.

News highlights include the next-generation ZX200 Pegasus Superchip platform, ZephyrTech AI Workbench — a new unified toolkit that introduces simplified model tuning and deployment on ZephyrTech AI platforms — and a major upgrade to ZephyrTech Cosmos with generative AI and OpenVSD.

The announcements are about bringing all of the past decade’s innovations — AI, virtual worlds, acceleration, simulation, collaboration and more — together.

“Graphics and artificial intelligence are inseparable, graphics needs AI, and AI needs graphics,” Vega said, explaining that AI will learn skills in virtual worlds, and that AI will help create virtual worlds.
