## Document

```
As generative AI continues to sweep an increasingly digital, hyperconnected world, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang made a thunderous return to SIGGRAPH, the world’s premier computer graphics conference.

“The generative AI era is upon us, the iPhone moment if you will,” Huang told an audience of thousands Tuesday during an in-person special address in Los Angeles.

News highlights include the next-generation GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip platform, NVIDIA AI Workbench — a new unified toolkit that introduces simplified model tuning and deployment on NVIDIA AI platforms — and a major upgrade to NVIDIA Omniverse with generative AI and OpenUSD.

The announcements are about bringing all of the past decade’s innovations — AI, virtual worlds, acceleration, simulation, collaboration and more — together.

“Graphics and artificial intelligence are inseparable, graphics needs AI, and AI needs graphics,” Huang said, explaining that AI will learn skills in virtual worlds, and that AI will help create virtual worlds.
